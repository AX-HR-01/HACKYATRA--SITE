            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                HACKYATRA began as a small effort by students at IIT Patna to make hackathons more approachable for
                newcomers.
                What started as a single WhatsApp group sharing opportunities and learning resources has grown into a
                connected
                community across platforms. Weâ€™ve moved from WhatsApp to a larger WhatsApp Community, then to Discord,
                and now, this website â€” our next step in making information, events, and guidance easily accessible.

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                We aim to provide an entry point into the world of hackathons for students and beginners from all
                backgrounds.
                By connecting members with opportunities, mentors, and peers, we hope to encourage collaboration,
                creative problem-solving, and hands-on learning that extends beyond the classroom.

            <h2>Why HACKYATRA?</h2>
            <p>
                We believe that every great journey begins with a single step.
                For many aspiring innovators, hackathons can be that first step â€”
                a place to learn, experiment, and build.
                HACKYATRA is here to make that step less intimidating, more accessible, and more exciting.
